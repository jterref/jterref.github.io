                <p>
                    I am J. Terref, or just "Jay", a white ferret biologist. Besides being a scientist, I am also an amateur artist, an amateur programmer, 
                    a language/culture enthusiast and... well... let's just say I love learning new things. I am as curious as ferrets come, I gues...
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created this website mostly to encourage me to create things (and for the fun of it). But also, it would be great to someday share stuff with people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here you can find my <b><a href="gallery.html">gallery</a></b> (which is mostly empty), my personal <b><a href="fdtg.html">Furry Drawing Theme Generator</a></b> (which I intend to use more) 
                    and ways to <b><a href="contact.html">contact me</a></b>. In the ideal future you would find much more stuff in here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's currently mostly empty, but it's ready to be filled with lots of things. So... <b>go me!</b>
